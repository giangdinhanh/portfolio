<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">1.1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>LifeSpan Initiative is dedicated to understanding what affects how long people live around the world.</p>
<p>Many past studies missed key factors like infectious diseases and only looked at one year of data.</p>
<p>We take a broader view—analyzing 193 countries from 2000 to 2015 using trusted data from WHO and the UN.</p>
<p>Our research focuses on four main areas: Immunization, Mortality, Economic, and Social factors.</p>
<p>Our goal is to find what truly drives life expectancy and help countries with lower life expectancy create better health policies.</p>
</section>
<section id="case-study" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study">1.2. CASE STUDY</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Life expectancy is a key measure of national health and development. According to this need, LifeSpan Initiative was launched to provide a clear and accurate understanding of what drives life expectancy across the globe.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To identify the most influential health, economic, and social factors affecting life expectancy, and to guide evidence-based policy for countries with low life expectancy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Countries analyzed: 194</li>
<li>Time frame: 2000–2015</li>
<li>Sources: WHO &amp; UN datasets (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who</a>)</li>

<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>Why did certain things happen? What are some causes and effects within the topic?</td>

<p>Since the dataset includes 13 variables, the Best Model was selected and compared with a Multiple Regression model built using only the variables with the highest positive and highest negative coefficients.</p>
<p>The objective is to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify which variables contribute the most to Life Expectancy</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the most efficient resources for improving lifespan</p></li>
<li><p>Achieve the highest R-squared value for model performance</p></li>

<p>=&gt; Best Model for Multiple Regression will be used for further analysis and recommendations.</p>

<p>According to the analysis, when Life Expectancy is the dependent variable, the Best Model recommends 9 variables to achieve the highest R-squared value.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Multiple Regression model built based on the Correlation Matrix only includes 5 variables whose coefficients are greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5.</p>

<p>The Best Model returned a model with 9 variables and achieved an R-squared of 81.7%. Meanwhile, the manual Multiple Regression model, which selected only 5 variables (all of which have significant contributions), reached an R-squared of 80.4% - just 1.3% lower than the Best Model.</p>
<p>Therefore, the LifeSpan Initiative should consider using the Multiple Regression model for faster tracking and easier adaptation since it requires fewer resources for data collection. By focusing on these key contributing factors, the organization can improve Life Expectancy more efficiently.</p>

<p>After running Elbow Method, the Optimal K for both K-Means models are 2 (when doing square root of 5-6 continents, the number is equal to 2).</p>
<p>That is why the model uses K=2 for observing.</p>

<p>Based on health factors, we can measure which variables influenced predictions mostly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HIV.AIDS =&gt; Highly predictor for Africa and some America/Asia.</p></li>
<li><p>BMI =&gt; Distinctive for America/Africa or America/Asia.</p></li>
<li><p>Adult Mortality =&gt; Minor but to distinguish Europe/America.</p></li>
<li><p>Thinness 1-19 years =&gt; Minor but helps separate Europe/America/Australia/Asia.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By using Health Factors in Decision Tree for grouping Continent according to variables: Adult Mortality,HIV/AIDS, BMI, and thinness 1-19 years, the model returned 72.449% accuracy in prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The model performs best for Asia then Africa and Europe where health pattern are more distinguish.</p></li>
<li><p>Australia and America show higher overlap due to similar health indicators.</p></li>
<li><p>Oceania is unused because of very limited data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, Random Forest seems much better than Decision Tree when the accuracy reached 89.05% (17% improvement)</p>

<p>Random Forest significantly outperforms Decision Tree across all continents, especially in smaller sample size like Oceania and Australia)</p>
<p>The high accuracy (89% in total and 97% for Africa, 90% for Asia) made by Random Forest proves Health Factors are strong predictors for continent classification.</p>

<h1>5. CONCLUSION</h1>
<p><strong>Key contributors for Life Expectancy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Positive: Schooling (0.73), Income Composition of Resources (0.7), BMI (0.54)</p></li>
<li><p>Negative: Adult Mortality (-0.7), HIV.AIDS (-0.59)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recommend Multiple Regression for faster, cost effective tracking:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Life Expectancy = -0.017* Adult Mortality + 0.043*BMI - 0.503*HIV/AIDS + 8.908*Income Composition of Resources + 1.116*Schooling + 52.37</p></li>
<li><p>R-squared: 80.4%</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Insight:</strong></p>
<p>Social factors (2000 - 2010):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Schooling improved significantly in low income countries, narrowing gaps.</p></li>
<li><p>Income composition rose slightly; Europe remain top performer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Health factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Random Forest accuracy: 89.05%</p></li>
<li><p>HIV/AIDS, BMI, and Thinness 1-19 years, and Adult Mortality are the strongest predictors of continent health pattern.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Focus on 5 keys factors: Schooling, Income Composition of Resources, BMI, Adult Mortality, and HIV/AIDS for efficient monitoring.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize education &amp; income policies to improve lifespan.</p></li>
<li><p>Tailor Health program based on dominant risk factors to indicate countries group then have suitable develop strategies.</p></li>
